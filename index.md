SPEP/Transforming Grace Podcast
===============================

These are links to [rss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feeds that will work in [podcast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) applications, such as iTunes. 

* Current Sermons [iTunes](itpc://podcast.spepmedia.com/sermons.xml), [RSS](http://podcast.spepmedia.com/sermons.xml)
* Good News Archive [iTunes](itpc://podcast.spepmedia.com/goodNews.xml), [RSS](http://podcast.spepmedia.com/goodNews.xml)

What to do with these
=====================
What you do with these links depends on what platform you're on. Find the 
instructions for your platform and follow them. 

Windows
-------
If you use iTunes, click the iTunes link. This should open our podcast feed in
iTunes, from which you can view and download all the sermons. 

If you don't use iTunes, download a Podcast Client such as
[gPodder](http://gpodder.org/). Then copy the RSS link and add it to your
podcast client. 

Mac
---
Once again, if you use iTunes, simply click the iTunes Link. This is the 
suggested method for the Mac, since iTunes is already insatalled. 

If you don't want to use iTunes, [gPodder](http://gpodder.org/) is also 
available for the Mac. 

iOS

Coming Soon!

Android
-------
For Android, download a podcast client, such as [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en). If your client is well written, clicking the iTunes link should add it to your podcast client.
If this doesn't work, copy the RSS URL from above, and look for an "Add Feed" 
option in your podcast client, then paste the URL into the URL field. 

Getting Help
------------
If you are a regular attender of SPEP, stopping by the sound booth after the 
11:00 service may be a viable option. If you're not a regular attender of SPEP,
you can send us [email.](http://spepchurch.org/contactus/contact_media.html)
